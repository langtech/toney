<h1>Toney</h1>

<p>
Toney is a tone classification tool.  Use it to listen to and view F0
contours, and manually sort wordforms or phrases into clusters.  It
requires a specially formatted TextGrid file and a corresponding audio
file.  Samples are provided below.
</p>

<p>
Use the File menu to open TextGrid file(s).  Double-click on a word to
hear it.  Use the Edit menu to add a cluster, then drag items from the
scratch area (bottom of screen) to a cluster, or between clusters.
See the Help menu for more user documentation.
