Toney: Software for Phonetic Classification
===========================================

Toney is a software tool that supports classification of spoken forms into
phonetic categories, especially categories defined in terms of fundamental
frequency.

Users click on tokens to hear them, and after hearing a few tokens,
users form an initial hypothesis about how these are classified. Users create
as many categories as required, and drag each token to the desired category.
All tokens in a given category can be played back, and any outliers are easily
identified, and moved to their correct category.  In the process, the user
develops an ear for the linguistically-salient phonetic distinctions.
