User Interface
--------------

The user interface is divided into two regions.  The lower area is a canvas containing unclassified items.
You can double-click on them to hear them, and drag them around the canvas to form preliminary clusters.
The forms can be clustered according to any phonetic category of interest.

Once a putative category has been identified, use the ``edit`` menu to create a cluster.
Give the cluster a label, and drag forms into it.  Create as many clusters as desired.
Click on the small play button at the bottom of the cluster to listen to all items in
the cluster in sequence.  Any items that do not belong in the cluster can be moved out of it.
