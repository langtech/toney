<h1 class="title">User Interface</h1>

<p>The user interface is divided into two regions.  The lower area is a
canvas containing unclassified linguistic forms.  You can double-click
on an item to hear it, and drag it so that it is closer to items that
sound similar.  The forms can be clustered according to any phonetic
category of interest.</p>
<p>Once a putative category has been identified, use the <tt class="docutils literal">edit</tt> menu to
create a cluster.  Give the cluster a label, and drag forms into it.
Create as many clusters as desired.  Click on the small play button at
the bottom of the cluster to listen to all items in the cluster in
sequence.  Any items that do not belong in the cluster can be moved
out of it.</p>
<p>If the forms were collected using an elicitation frame, where these
are indicated using the &quot;frame&quot; tier in the TextGrid file, then the
display of frame labels can be turned on and off using the <tt class="docutils literal">view</tt>
menu.  If a speaker identifier is indicated using the &quot;speaker&quot; tier
in the TextGrid file, then this can also be controlled using the <tt class="docutils literal">view</tt> menu.
To listen to forms with the frame, use right-click (on the canvas)
or the large play button (at the bottom of the cluster box).</p>
<p>To delete a cluster and return any items it contains to the canvas,
click on the <tt class="docutils literal">X</tt> button.</p>
<p>Click on the F0 tab to see the F0 traces for the items in the cluster.
When switching between the <tt class="docutils literal">label</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">F0</tt> tab, the highlighted
form stays the same.  Thus, any outlying F0 trace can be easily associated with
the corresponding form, and it can be moved out of the cluster.</p>
<p>Click on the border area of a cluster to pick up the cluster and drag it to
a new position.</p>
