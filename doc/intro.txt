Toney: Software for Phonetic Classification
-------------------------------------------

Introduction

Toney is a software tool that supports classification of utterance tokens into phonetic categories,
especially classes defined in terms of fundamental frequency.
Users click on tokens to hear them, and after hearing a few tokens, users form an
initial hypothesis about how these are classified.
Users create as many categories as required, and drag each token to the desired category.
All tokens in a given category can be played back, and any outliers are easily identified,
and moved to their correct category.  In the process, the user develops an ear for the
linguistically-salient phonetic distinctions.


File Format

Toney works with the Praat TextGrid format.  It requires a "target" tier, and optionally uses
"frame" and "speaker" tiers.  Examples of the file format are available for download.
The target tier contains transcriptions of the tokens of interest.
Transcriptions consist of a segmental component and a category ("X" for unknown), separated by colon.
Toney only considers the labels that contain this colon; other labels are ignored.

For example, a target tier might contain the following sequence of word labels: <tt>muta paroma:X kidenu</tt>.
In this case, only the second item <tt>paroma</tt> would be displayed.  If the user created a
class called LMH (low-mid-high), then the TextGrid file would be modified to contain
<tt>muta paroma:LMH kidenu</tt>.

As another example, a target tier might contain the following sequence of syllable labels: <tt>mu ta pa:L ro:X ma:H ki de nu</tt>.
In this case, only the sylables <tt>pa</tt>, <tt>ro</tt>, and <tt>ma</tt> would be displayed.
Two categories <tt>L</tt> and <tt>H</tt> would be populated with <tt>pa</tt> and </tt>ma</tt> respectively.
However, <tt>ro</tt> would be displayed without any category.  If the user created a new <tt>M</tt> category,
and moved all three syllables into this category, then the TextGrid file would be
modified to contain <tt>mu ta pa:M ro:M ma:M ki de nu</tt>.

The optional frame tier is used to delimit a larger span of recorded material that contains the
(sentence) frame in which the target form was elicited (e.g. <tt>F1</tt> for Frame 1).
The optional frame tier is used to provide a speaker identifier, such as initials (e.g. <tt>PT</tt>).
The <tt>View</tt> menu can be used to toggle the display of this extra information.
Thus, a token <tt>paroma</tt> could appear as <tt>paroma-F1-PT</tt> in the display,
enabling the user to study variability due to the elicitation frame or the speaker.
