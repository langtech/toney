To start the tool, run the Toney.sh program.

This version requires an external program for playing audio: play. This is a
command line utility that comes with SoX [1]. Install SoX and make sure that
the play command is available, i.e. make sure that it exists under /usr/bin or
/usr/local/bin directory.

More documentation is available from the Help menu of the tool.

The source code for this program is avialable at github:
